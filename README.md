# Amazon-Product-Recommendation

The objective of this analysis is to determine the most reviewed product on Amazon for product recommendation, based on the given dataset. It also determines the users who gave the most reviews on Amazon. This analysis would help Amazon improve the accuracy of the recommendations for a new user. 
The first step involves finding a dataset for use, for analysis. The dataset is downloaded from the public dataset repository on Kaggle.com. The link to the dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/code/prokaggler/amazon-product-recommendation/data. After getting the data, Python is used to program and process the data. The columns are given headers to show the user, the productid, the ratings of the users, and the time the rating was recorded. However, for analysis, we don’t need the time the rating was recorded. Therefore, the timestamp column is dropped and the final dataset saved as a new document. 
Analysis is then done using python to determine the top users who rated the products. It is also done to determine the most rated products based on the ratings. The results are plotted using Python code to show this. Based on this information, the data is also used in Tableau to make visualizations to plot and determine the most rated products and the top users who rated the products based on user ID’s and productid’s.
